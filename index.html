  <p><b>SEVENTEEN</b> is a South Korean boy band formed by Pledis Entertainment. The group consists of thirteen members: S.Coups, Jeonghan, Joshua, Jun, Hoshi, Wonwoo, Woozi, DK, Mingyu, The8, Seungkwan, Vernon, and Dino. 
   <br> The group debuted on May 26, 2015 with the extended play 17 Carat, which became the longest-charting K-pop album of the year in the US and the only rookie album to appear on Billboard's "10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015" list.
   <br> Seventeen is considered a "self-producing" idol group, with the members actively involved in songwriting and choreographing, as well as many other aspects of their music and performances. 
   <br> They perform as one group and are divided into three units—hip-hop, vocal, and performance—each with a different area of specialization. 
   <br> They have been labeled "Performance Kings", "Theater Kids of K-Pop", and "K-Pop Performance Powerhouse'" by various domestic and international media outlets.</p>
